		<h2>Deliberative Agent</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains an explicitly represented, symbolic model of the world</li>

        <h2>Two important problems</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The transduction problem: that of translating the real world into an accurate, adequate symbolic description, in time for that description to be useful. (vision, speech understanding, learning, etc)</li>
            <li>The representation/reasoning problem: that of how to symbolically represent information about complex real-world entities and processes, and how to get agents to reason with this information in time for the results to be useful. (knowledge representation, automated reasoning, automatic planning, etc.)</li>

        <h2>Critical thinking</h2><em>(personal view)</em>
        Agents can be useful to strengthen people's critical thinking.
        <p>
            What critical thinking is?
            Imagine you say there is no such thing as global warming.
            If there is evidence that tells global warming is the truth, and you say is not the truth, then you are in denial.
            Suppose you believe it, and afterwards you learn new evidence that falsifies it. If you can change your opinion, then your thought is critical.
            This ability to think critically helps us to interact effectively. Automated reasoning could be useful if its not biased.

        Multi-agent systems can be
        <ul>
            <li>Competitive</li>
            <li>Collaborative</li>
            <li>Hybrids</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In competitive negotiation, agents are self-interested and maximize their local utility.
            Cooperative setups try to maximize their global utility, they need to take into account activities of all the agents in the system.

                objectives)</li>
            <li>Q: Negotiation strategy? (a function of specifics of the negotiation scenario and the negotiation protocol)</li>

            <li>Can be clustered according to one metric (i.e simmilarity)</li>

        models and operations from other agents.
        I believe that to interpret models, we need the traces.
