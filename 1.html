        Note these systems were conceived before the web and are traditionally message based.
        We can still explore all this again, from hypermedia-comunica perspective.

        Questions:
        <ul>

    <section class="slide">
        <h2>Multi agent systems</h2>
        Multi-agent systems can be
        <ul>
            <li>Competitive</li>
            <li>Collaborative</li>
            <li>Hybrids</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In competitive negotiation, agents are self-interested and maximize their local utility.
            Cooperative setups try to maximize their global utility, they need to take into account activities of all the agents in the system.

                objectives)</li>
            <li>Q: Negotiation strategy? (a function of specifics of the negotiation scenario and the negotiation protocol)</li>

            <li>Their (partial) ontology each</li>
            <li>Can be clustered according to one metric (i.e simmilarity)</li>
            <li>Can collect knowledge to their spaces (they can have state)</li>
            <li>If they cannot, (knowledge too alien for them) they can ask for to translator peers</li>
